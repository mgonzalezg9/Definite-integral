# Definite Integrals Calculator
> A pascal program that calculates the definite integral of a function given the upper and lower limits of the integral.

## Method
The method used is the Trapezoidal rule. By default it calculates the integral for the function f(x) = xÂ². However, this method is applicable for any function just changing the function definition in the Pascal code.

## Running the file

It requires to install the <a href="https://www.freepascal.org/">Free Pascal Compiler</a> (fpc):

```sh
$ fpc aproxintegral.pas
```
Now we can execute the binary file
```sh
